## Approach & Efficiency Insert

i take an Approach using binary search algorithms by going through the array and comparing the value to the middle of the array and then dividing the array in half until the value is found.

Space Complexity: O(1) because we are creating small variable.
Time Complexity: O(log(N) base 2)
